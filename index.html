    <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date: 10th June, 2025</strong></p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Welcome to Dhwani! These Terms and Conditions ("Terms") govern your use of
      the Dhwani mobile application ("App" or "Service"). By downloading or
      using the App, you agree to comply with these Terms. If you do not agree,
      please do not use the App.
    </p>

    <h2>2. App Functionality</h2>
    <p>
      Dhwani is a utility app designed for individuals, especially singers, to
      capture photos via camera or select images from their gallery and convert
      them into a PDF format for storing lyrics or reference content. The app is
      meant for personal productivity and creative use.
    </p>

    <h2>3. User Content and Storage</h2>
    <p>
      All photos and PDFs created within the app are stored locally on your
      device unless explicitly uploaded by you. Dhwani uses Firebase services to
      store only your name, email, and user ID (when you sign in with Apple or a
      similar method). No media files (images, PDFs) are uploaded to cloud
      storage unless this feature is added and enabled by the user in future
      versions.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Permissions</h2>
    <p>
      To provide its core features, Dhwani may request the following
      permissions:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Camera:</strong> To capture images for PDF creation.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Gallery Access:</strong> To select existing photos from your
        device.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Biometric Authentication:</strong> To secure access to the
        document stored within the app using Face ID or Touch ID.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Contacts:</strong> Used only to show your contact card profile
        photo (e.g., Memoji) locally. No contacts are uploaded or stored.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Permissions are required for full functionality but are requested with
      your consent.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Account and Authentication</h2>
    <p>
      Dhwani uses Firebase Authentication and Firestore to manage user accounts.
      When signing in (e.g., with Apple ID), your name, email, and user ID may
      be collected and securely stored in Firebase. This data is used solely for
      account personalization and secure usage across devices (if enabled).
    </p>

    <h2>6. Data Deletion</h2>
    <p>
      You may request deletion of your account data (name, email, user ID)
      stored in Firebase by contacting us at
      <a href="mailto:manasdevslopes@gmail.com">manasdevslopes@gmail.com</a>.
      Locally stored files and documents must be deleted manually from your
      device.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Content Ownership</h2>
    <p>
      All media (photos, PDFs) you create using Dhwani remain your intellectual
      property. Dhwani does not claim ownership or reuse rights to your content.
      You may delete your content at any time.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Submissions</h2>
    <p>
      If you send feedback, suggestions, or feature ideas to Dhwani, you agree
      that these submissions may be used by us without obligation, compensation,
      or acknowledgment. They become non-confidential and may help improve the
      app.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Global Availability and Local Compliance</h2>
    <p>
      The Dhwani app is available globally. It is your responsibility to ensure
      compliance with local laws in your region when using this app.
    </p>

    <h2>10. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>
      Dhwani is provided on an "as-is" and "as-available" basis. We do not
      guarantee the app will be error-free, uninterrupted, or suitable for every
      use case. To the fullest extent permitted by law, Dhwani shall not be
      liable for any damages resulting from your use of or inability to use the
      app.
    </p>

    <h2>11. Modifications to Terms</h2>
    <p>
      We reserve the right to update or change these Terms at any time. When
      changes are made, we will revise the “Last updated” date at the top of
      this page. Continued use of the app after changes constitutes your
      acceptance of the new Terms.
    </p>

    <h2>12. Termination</h2>
    <p>
      We may suspend or terminate access to the Dhwani app at any time without
      prior notice or liability, for any reason whatsoever, including but not
      limited to a breach of these Terms.
    </p>

    <h2>13. Disclaimer</h2>
    <p>
      Dhwani does not provide warranties of any kind. We disclaim all liability
      related to your use of the app, third-party links, and loss of content or
      data.
    </p>

    <h2>14. Governing Law</h2>
    <p>
      These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of
      your local jurisdiction, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.
